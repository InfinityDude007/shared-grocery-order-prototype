Function Overview:
Lifecycle manager for the FastAPI application, used for setting up resources before the application starts.

Function Logic:
1. Wait for the database to be created before starting the application.
2. Yield control back to FastAPI to start the app, ensuring setup is completed first.

"""
Endpoint Overview:
Test route to verify if the FastAPI application is running correctly.

Function Logic:
1. The endpoint responds with a simple JSON message indicating that the route was called successfully.

Returns:
- A dictionary with a success message (FastAPI will automatically serialize this to a JSON response).
# Return a dictionary that FastAPI will automatically serialize to JSON
